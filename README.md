# CPE-Final-Project-EMF-GHOST-DETECTOR
Final project for my CPE class. Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Detector built in Arduino. 
Layfield, Aidan 

The file "Arduino_EMF_Prot1" is the code for my first prototype and original design. The file "Project_EMF_Layfield_Aidan" is the code for my final design. Both are shown in the video.

This project is a challenge that was presented to me from Shawn in one of the labs (more so as a brief suggestion for a creative outlook). The idea was creating a "ghost detector" in Arduino, otherwise known professionally as an EMF detector. I decided to try and accomplish it in Arduino and it was more than possible. Electromagnetic field detectors, or EMF detectors, are devices used to detect and measure the strength of electromagnetic fields. EMFs are produced by various sources such as electrical appliances, power lines, wireless devices, and other electronic equipment. EMF detectors typically work by using sensors or antennas to detect changes in the electric and magnetic fields in the surrounding environment. Which all of this was more than provided in the Arduino kits we use for class. I created in the first prototype a simple design that gave an EMF reading using resistors and 10 LEDs. As more of the LEDs lit up, the more energy was being detected. In my final design I added a buzzer that makes a sound when energy is being detected (just like the real ghost detectors). I also added a 16x2 LCD display to give you a "ghost level" or level of energy being detected. I really enjoyed working on this project and can't wait for more challenges in the future!
